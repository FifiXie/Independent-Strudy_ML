david i think this point is moot for the time being because as of last tuesday we are not dealing with bidder d i think it is ok legally to go this way although there is potential liability under the warn act the plant closing law we probably can schedule around that exposure though by giving everyone who possibly may be affected days notice practically however this would not be my favorite approach i d prefer it if we could have the ability to compete for top performers but we should be able to manage that by working through the persons who we identify and present for possible hiring by the buyer i would like more information about what is meant by ena does not interfere with the offers made by the buyer does that mean no counteroffers to answer the question of whether we can bind all of enron i would say that it is unlikely unless we want to ask it is easier to commit only the wholesale group rather than ask corp ees broadband etc whether they will abide by the agreement so i would recommend limiting it to that group if possible we may be able to include the pipelines given that they have been involved in this transaction let me know if you have any questions michelle

dismissal under our severance plan between signing and closing bidder d provide us with a list of offerees designated employees to whom bidder d intends to make offers of employment ena covenants that we will not interfere with bidder d s offers can we bind all of enron if an offeree turns down the offer in writing then ena is free to continue to employee offeree however if we do not continue to employ the offeree no severance is owed the intent of the above is to encourage offerees to take the offers they give up severance rights if they don t but provide us the opportunity to continue to

performers but we should be able to manage that by working through the persons who we identify and present for possible hiring by the buyer i would like more information about what is meant by ena does not interfere with the offers made by the buyer does that mean no counteroffers to answer the question of whether we can bind all of enron i would say that it is unlikely unless we want to ask it is easier to commit only the wholesale group rather than ask corp ees broadband etc whether they will abide by the agreement so i would recommend limiting it to that group if possible we may be able to include the pipelines given that they have been involved in this transaction let me know if you have any questions michelle david oxley pm to michelle cash hou ect ect fran l mayes hou ect ect cc subject triple lutz employee matters what s your view forwarded by david oxley hou ect on pm timothy j detmering pm to david oxley hou ect ect brian redmond hou ect ect patrick wade hou ect ect anne c koehler hou ect ect cc subject triple lutz employee matters with respect to bidder d we are being asked not to compete with them for those employees they would like to hire i e we have to sever them and bidder d gets to hire them if they want to in which case the severed employees get no severance payment if they turn dfs down i would like to propose something like the following we provide bidder d with a list of all designated employees their position historical compensation bidder d covenants to make offers to of certain pools of designated employees e g commercial operations engineering trading etc bidder d covenants to make offers that will not allow designated employees to successfully claim constructive dismissal under our severance plan between signing and closing bidder d provide us with a list of offerees designated employees to whom bidder d intends to make offers of employment ena covenants that we will not interfere with bidder d s offers can we bind all of enron if an offeree turns down the offer in writing then ena is free to continue to employee offeree however if we do not continue to employ the offeree no severance is owed the intent of the above is to encourage offerees to take the offers they give up severance rights if they don t but provide us the opportunity to continue to employee anyone who is bold enough to turn it down and that we want to keep also it caps our severance obligation by requiring bidder d to specify how many offers must be made bidder d is certain to want more than this but i am uncomfortable saying we can t continue to

should be able to manage that by working through the persons who we identify and present for possible hiring by the buyer i would like more information about what is meant by ena does not interfere with the offers made by the buyer does that mean no counteroffers to answer the question of whether we can bind all of enron i would say that it is unlikely unless we want to ask it is easier to commit only the wholesale group rather than ask corp ees broadband etc whether they will abide by the agreement so i would recommend limiting it to that group if possible we may be able to include the

gets to hire them if they want to in which case the severed employees get no severance payment if they turn dfs down i would like to propose something like the following we provide bidder d with a

bidder d covenants to make offers that will not allow designated employees to successfully claim constructive dismissal under our severance plan between signing and closing bidder d provide us with a list of offerees designated employees to whom bidder d intends to make offers of employment ena covenants that we will not interfere with bidder d s offers can we bind all of enron if an offeree turns down the offer in writing then ena is free to continue to employee offeree however if we do not continue to employ the offeree no severance is owed the intent of the above is to encourage offerees to take the offers they give up severance rights if they don t but provide us the opportunity to continue to employee anyone who is bold enough to turn it down and that we want to keep also it caps our

who we identify and present for possible hiring by the buyer i would like more information about what is meant by ena does not interfere with the offers made by the buyer does that mean no counteroffers to answer the question of whether we can bind all of enron i would say that it is unlikely unless we want to ask it is easier to commit only the wholesale group rather than ask corp ees broadband etc whether they will abide by the agreement so i would recommend limiting it to that group if possible we may be able to include the pipelines given that they have been involved in this transaction let me know if you have any questions michelle david oxley pm to michelle cash hou ect ect fran l mayes hou ect ect cc subject triple lutz employee matters what s your view forwarded by david oxley hou ect on pm timothy j detmering pm to david oxley hou ect ect brian redmond hou ect ect patrick wade hou ect ect anne c koehler hou ect ect cc subject triple lutz employee matters with respect to bidder d we are being asked not to compete with them for those employees they would like to hire i e we have to sever them and bidder d gets to hire them if they want to in which case the severed employees get no severance payment if they turn dfs down i would like to propose something like the following we provide bidder d with a list of all designated employees their position historical compensation bidder d covenants to make offers to of certain pools of designated employees e g commercial operations engineering trading etc bidder d covenants to make offers that will not allow designated employees to successfully claim constructive dismissal under our severance plan between signing and closing bidder d provide us with a list of offerees designated employees to whom bidder d intends to make offers of employment ena covenants that we will not interfere with bidder d s offers can we bind all of enron if an offeree turns down the offer in writing then ena is free to continue to employee offeree however if we do not continue to employ the offeree no severance is owed the intent of the above is to encourage offerees to take the offers they give up severance rights if they don t but provide us the opportunity to continue to employee anyone who is bold enough to turn it down and that we want to keep also it caps our severance obligation by requiring bidder d to specify how many offers must be made bidder d is certain to want more than this but i am uncomfortable saying we can t continue to employee any of the offerees please advise david i think this point

present for possible hiring by the buyer i would like more information about what is meant by ena does not interfere with the offers made by the buyer does that mean no counteroffers to answer the question of whether we can bind all of enron i would say that it is unlikely unless we want to ask it is easier to commit only the wholesale group rather than ask corp ees broadband etc whether they will abide by the agreement so i would recommend limiting it to that group if possible we may be able to include the pipelines given that they have been involved in this transaction let me know if you

asked not to compete with them for those employees they would like to hire i e we have to sever them and bidder d gets to hire them if they want to in which case the severed employees get no severance payment if they turn dfs down i would like to propose something like the following we provide bidder d with a list of all designated employees their position historical compensation bidder d covenants to make offers to of certain pools of designated employees e g commercial operations engineering trading etc bidder d covenants to make offers that will not allow designated employees to successfully claim constructive dismissal under our severance plan between signing and closing bidder d provide us with a list of offerees designated employees to whom bidder d intends to make offers of employment ena covenants that we will not interfere with bidder d s offers can we bind all of enron if an offeree turns down the offer in writing then ena is free to continue to employee offeree however if we do not continue to employ the offeree no severance is owed the intent of the above is to encourage offerees to take the offers they give up severance rights if they don t but provide us the opportunity to continue to employee anyone who is bold enough to turn it down and that we want to keep also it caps our severance obligation by requiring bidder d to specify how many offers must be made bidder d

more information about what is meant by ena does not interfere with the offers made by the buyer does that mean no counteroffers to answer the question of whether we can bind all of enron i would say that it is unlikely unless we want to ask it is easier to commit only the wholesale group rather than ask corp ees broadband etc whether they will abide by the agreement so i would recommend limiting it to that group if possible we may be able to include the pipelines given that they have been involved in this transaction let me know if you have any questions michelle david oxley pm to michelle

they would like to hire i e we have to sever them and bidder d gets to hire them if they want to in which case the severed employees get no severance payment if they turn dfs down i would like to propose something like the following we provide bidder d with a list of all designated employees their position historical compensation bidder d covenants to make offers to of certain pools of designated employees e g commercial operations engineering trading etc bidder d covenants to make offers that will not allow designated employees to successfully claim constructive dismissal under our severance plan between signing and closing bidder d provide us with a list of offerees designated employees to whom bidder d intends to make offers of employment ena covenants that we will not interfere with bidder d s offers can we bind all of enron if an offeree turns down the offer in writing then ena is free to continue to employee offeree however if we do not continue to employ the offeree no severance is owed the intent of the above is to encourage offerees to take the offers they give up severance rights if they don t but provide us the opportunity to continue to employee anyone who is bold enough to turn it down and that we want to keep also it caps our severance obligation by requiring bidder d to specify how many offers must be made bidder d is certain to want more

does not interfere with the offers made by the buyer does that mean no counteroffers to answer the question of whether we can bind all of enron i would say that it is unlikely unless we want to ask it is easier to commit only the wholesale group rather than ask corp ees broadband etc whether they will abide by the agreement so i would recommend limiting it to that group if possible we may be able

and bidder d gets to hire them if they want to in which case the severed employees get no severance payment if they turn dfs down i would like to propose something like the following we provide bidder d with a list of all designated employees their position historical compensation bidder d covenants to make offers to of certain pools of designated employees e g commercial operations engineering trading etc bidder d covenants to make offers that will not allow designated employees to successfully claim constructive dismissal under our severance plan between signing and closing bidder d provide us with a list of offerees designated employees to whom bidder d intends to make offers of employment ena covenants that we will not interfere with bidder d s offers can we bind all of enron if an offeree turns down the offer in writing then ena is free to continue to employee offeree however if we do not continue to employ the offeree no severance is owed the intent of the above is to encourage offerees to take the offers they give up severance rights if they don t but provide us the opportunity to continue to employee anyone who is bold enough to turn it down and that we want to keep also it caps our severance obligation by requiring bidder d to specify how many offers must be made bidder d is certain to want more than this but i am uncomfortable saying we can t continue to employee any of the offerees please advise david i think this point is moot for the time being because as of last tuesday we are not dealing with bidder d i think it is ok legally to go this way

commit only the wholesale group rather than ask corp ees broadband etc whether they will abide by the agreement so i would recommend limiting it to that group if possible we may be able to include the

gets to hire them if they want to in which case the severed employees get no severance payment if they turn dfs down i would like to propose something like the following we provide bidder d with a list of all designated employees their position historical compensation bidder d covenants to make offers to of certain pools of designated employees e g commercial operations engineering trading etc bidder d covenants to make offers that will not allow designated employees to successfully claim constructive dismissal under our severance plan between signing and closing bidder d provide us with a list of offerees designated employees to whom bidder d intends to make offers of employment ena covenants that we will not interfere with bidder d s offers can we bind all of enron if an offeree turns down the offer in writing then ena is free to continue to employee offeree however if we do not continue to employ the offeree no severance is owed the intent of the above is to encourage offerees to take the offers they give up severance rights if they don t but provide us the opportunity to continue to employee anyone who is bold enough to turn it down and that we want to keep also it caps our severance obligation by requiring bidder d to specify how many offers must be made bidder d is certain to want more than this but i am uncomfortable saying we can t continue to employee any of the offerees please advise david i think this point is moot for the time being because as of last tuesday we are not dealing with bidder d i think it is ok legally to go this way although there is

counteroffers to answer the question of whether we can bind all of enron i would say that it is unlikely unless we want to ask it is easier to commit only the wholesale group rather than ask corp ees broadband etc whether they will abide by the agreement so i would recommend limiting it to that group if possible we may be able to include the pipelines given that they have been involved in this transaction let me know if you have any questions michelle david oxley pm to michelle cash hou ect ect fran l mayes hou ect ect cc subject triple lutz employee matters what s your view forwarded by david oxley hou ect on pm timothy j detmering pm to david oxley hou ect ect brian redmond hou ect ect patrick wade hou ect ect anne c koehler hou ect ect cc subject triple lutz employee matters with respect to bidder d we are being asked not to compete with them for those employees they would like to hire i e we have to sever them and bidder d gets to hire them if they want to in which case the severed employees get no severance payment if they turn dfs down i would like to propose something like the following we provide bidder d with a list of all designated employees their position historical compensation bidder d covenants to make offers to of certain pools of designated employees e g commercial operations engineering trading etc bidder d covenants to make offers that will not allow designated employees to successfully claim constructive dismissal under our severance plan between signing and closing bidder d provide us with a list of offerees designated employees to whom bidder d intends to make offers of employment ena covenants that we will not interfere with bidder d s offers can we bind all of enron if an offeree turns down the offer in writing then ena is free to continue to employee offeree however if we do not continue to employ the offeree no severance is owed the intent of the above is to encourage offerees to take the offers they give up severance rights if they don t but provide us the opportunity to continue to employee anyone who is bold enough to turn it down and that we want to keep also it caps our severance obligation by requiring bidder d to specify how many offers must be made bidder d is certain to want more than this but i am uncomfortable saying we can t continue to employee any of the offerees please advise david i think this point is moot for the time being because as of last tuesday we are not dealing with bidder d i think it is ok legally to go this way although there is potential liability under the warn act the plant closing law we probably can schedule around that exposure though by giving everyone who possibly may be affected days notice practically however this would not be my favorite approach i d prefer it if

question of whether we can bind all of enron i would say that it is unlikely unless we want to ask it is easier to commit only the wholesale group rather than ask corp ees broadband etc whether they will abide by the agreement so i would recommend limiting it to that group if possible we may be able to include the pipelines given that they have been involved in this transaction let me know if you

asked not to compete with them for those employees they would like to hire i e we have to sever them and bidder d gets to hire them if they want to in which case the severed employees get no severance payment if they turn dfs down i would like to propose something like the following we provide bidder d with a list of all designated employees their position historical compensation bidder d covenants to make offers to of certain pools of designated employees e g commercial operations engineering trading etc bidder d covenants to make offers that will not allow designated employees to successfully claim constructive dismissal under our severance plan between signing and closing bidder d provide us with a list of offerees designated employees to whom bidder d intends to make offers of employment ena covenants that we will not interfere with bidder d s offers can we bind all of enron if an offeree turns down the offer in writing then ena is free to continue to employee offeree however if we do not continue to employ the offeree no severance is owed the intent of the above is to encourage offerees to take the offers they give up severance rights if they don t but provide us the opportunity to continue to employee anyone who is bold enough to turn it down and that we want to keep also it caps our severance obligation by requiring bidder d to specify how many offers must be made bidder d is certain to want more than this but i am uncomfortable saying we can t continue to employee any of the offerees please advise david i think this point is moot for the time being because as of last tuesday we are not dealing with bidder d i think it is ok legally to go this way although there is potential liability under the warn act the plant closing law we probably can schedule around that

that it is unlikely unless we want to ask it is easier to commit only the wholesale group rather than ask corp ees broadband etc whether they will abide by the agreement so i would recommend limiting

they would like to hire i e we have to sever them and bidder d gets to hire them if they want to in which case the severed employees get no severance payment if they turn dfs down i would like to propose something like the following we provide bidder d with a list of all designated employees their position historical compensation bidder d covenants to make offers to of certain pools of designated employees e g commercial operations engineering trading etc bidder d covenants to make offers that will not allow designated employees to successfully claim constructive dismissal under our severance plan between signing and closing bidder d provide us with a list of offerees designated employees to whom bidder d intends to make offers of employment ena covenants that we will not interfere with bidder d s offers can we bind all of enron if an offeree turns down the offer in writing then ena is free to continue to employee offeree however if we do not continue to employ the offeree no severance is owed the intent of the above is to encourage offerees to take the offers they give up severance rights if they don t but provide us the opportunity to continue to employee anyone who is bold enough to turn it down and that we want to keep also it caps our severance obligation by requiring bidder d to specify how many offers must be made bidder d is certain to want more than this but i am uncomfortable saying we can t continue to employee any of the offerees please advise david i think this point is moot for the time being because as of last tuesday we are not dealing with bidder d i think it is ok legally to go this way although there is potential liability under the warn act the plant closing law we probably can schedule around that exposure though by

is easier to commit only the wholesale group rather than ask corp ees broadband etc whether they will abide by the agreement so i would recommend limiting it to that group if possible we may be able

and bidder d gets to hire them if they want to in which case the severed employees get no severance payment if they turn dfs down i would like to propose something like the following we provide bidder d with a list of all designated employees their position historical compensation bidder d covenants to make offers to of certain pools of designated employees e g commercial operations engineering trading etc bidder d covenants to make offers that will not allow designated employees to successfully claim constructive dismissal under our severance plan between signing and closing bidder d provide us with a list of offerees designated employees to whom bidder d intends to make offers of employment ena covenants that we will not interfere with bidder d s offers can we bind all of enron if an offeree turns down the offer in writing then ena is free to continue to employee offeree however if we do not continue to employ the offeree no severance is owed the intent of the above is to encourage offerees to take the offers they give up severance rights if they don t but provide us the opportunity to continue to employee anyone who is bold enough to turn it down and that we want to keep also it caps our severance obligation by requiring bidder d to specify how many offers must be made bidder d is certain to want more than this but i am uncomfortable saying we can t continue to employee any of the offerees please advise david i think this point is moot for the time being because as of last tuesday we are not dealing with bidder d i think it is ok legally to go this way although there is potential liability under the warn act the plant closing law we probably can schedule around that exposure though by giving everyone who possibly may be affected days notice

gets to hire them if they want to in which case the severed employees get no severance payment if they turn dfs down i would like to propose something like the following we provide bidder d with a list of all designated employees their position historical compensation bidder d covenants to make offers to of certain pools of designated employees e g commercial operations engineering trading etc bidder d covenants to make offers that will not allow designated employees to successfully claim constructive dismissal under our severance plan between signing and closing bidder d provide us with a list of offerees designated employees to whom bidder d intends to make offers of employment ena covenants that we will not interfere with bidder d s offers can we bind all of enron if an offeree turns down the offer in writing then ena is free to continue to employee offeree however if we do not continue to employ the offeree no severance is owed the intent of the above is to encourage offerees to take the offers they give up severance rights if they don t but provide us the opportunity to continue to employee anyone who is bold enough to turn it down and that we want to keep also it caps our severance obligation by requiring bidder d to specify how many offers must be made bidder d is certain to want more than this but i am uncomfortable saying we can t continue to employee any of the offerees please advise david i think this point is moot for the time being because as of last tuesday we are not dealing with bidder d i think it is ok legally to go this way although there is

broadband etc whether they will abide by the agreement so i would recommend limiting it to that group if possible we may be able to include the pipelines given that they have been involved in this transaction let me know if you have any questions michelle david oxley pm to michelle cash hou ect ect fran l mayes hou ect ect cc subject triple lutz employee matters what s your view forwarded by david oxley hou ect on pm timothy j detmering pm to david oxley hou ect ect brian redmond hou ect ect patrick wade hou ect ect anne c koehler hou ect ect cc subject triple lutz employee matters with respect to bidder d we are being asked not to compete with them for those employees they would like to hire i e we have to sever them and bidder d gets to hire them if they want to in which case the severed employees get no severance payment if they turn dfs down i would like to propose something like the following we provide bidder d with a list of all designated employees their position historical compensation bidder d covenants to make offers to of certain pools of designated employees e g commercial operations engineering trading etc bidder d covenants to make offers that will not allow designated employees to successfully claim constructive dismissal under our severance plan between signing and closing bidder d provide us with a list of offerees designated employees to whom bidder d intends to make offers of employment ena covenants that we will not interfere with bidder d s offers can we bind all of enron if an offeree turns down the offer in writing then ena is free to continue to employee offeree however if we do not continue to employ the offeree no severance is owed the intent of the above is to encourage offerees to take the offers they give up severance rights if they don t but provide us the opportunity to continue to employee anyone who is bold enough to turn it down and that we want to keep also it caps our severance obligation by requiring bidder d to specify how many offers must be made bidder d is certain to want more than this but i am uncomfortable saying we can t continue to employee any of the offerees please advise david i think this point is moot for the time being because as of last tuesday we are not dealing with bidder d i think it is ok legally to go this way although there is potential liability under the warn act the plant closing law we probably can schedule around that exposure though by giving everyone who possibly may be affected days notice practically however this would not be my favorite approach i d prefer it if

will abide by the agreement so i would recommend limiting it to that group if possible we may be able to include the pipelines given that they have been involved in this transaction let me know if you

asked not to compete with them for those employees they would like to hire i e we have to sever them and bidder d gets to hire them if they want to in which case the severed employees get no severance payment if they turn dfs down i would like to propose something like the following we provide bidder d with a list of all designated employees their position historical compensation bidder d covenants to make offers to of certain pools of designated employees e g commercial operations engineering trading etc bidder d covenants to make offers that will not allow designated employees to successfully claim constructive dismissal under our severance plan between signing and closing bidder d provide us with a list of offerees designated employees to whom bidder d intends to make offers of employment ena covenants that we will not interfere with bidder d s offers can we bind all of enron if an offeree turns down the offer in writing then ena is free to continue to employee offeree however if we do not continue to employ the offeree no severance is owed the intent of the above is to encourage offerees to take the offers they give up severance rights if they don t but provide us the opportunity to continue to employee anyone who is bold enough to turn it down and that we want to keep also it caps our severance obligation by requiring bidder d to specify how many offers must be made bidder d is certain to want more than this but i am uncomfortable saying we can t continue to employee any of the offerees please advise david i think this point is moot for the time being because as of last tuesday we are not dealing with bidder d i think it is ok legally to go this way although there is potential liability under the warn act the plant closing law we probably can schedule around that exposure though by giving everyone who possibly may be affected days notice practically however this would not be my favorite approach i d prefer it if we could have the ability to compete for top

they would like to hire i e we have to sever them and bidder d gets to hire them if they want to in which case the severed employees get no severance payment if they turn dfs down i would like to propose something like the following we provide bidder d with a list of all designated employees their position historical compensation bidder d covenants to make offers to of certain pools of designated employees e g commercial operations engineering trading etc bidder d covenants to make offers that will not allow designated employees to successfully claim constructive dismissal under our severance plan between signing and closing bidder d provide us with a list of offerees designated employees to whom bidder d intends to make offers of employment ena covenants that we will not interfere with bidder d s offers can we bind all of enron if an offeree turns down the offer in writing then ena is free to continue to employee offeree however if we do not continue to employ the offeree no severance is owed the intent of the above is to encourage offerees to take the offers they give up severance rights if they don t but provide us the opportunity to continue to employee anyone who is bold enough to turn it down and that we want to keep also it caps our severance obligation by requiring bidder d to specify how many offers must be made bidder d is certain to want more than this but i am uncomfortable saying we can t continue to employee any of the offerees please advise david i think this point is moot for the time being because as of last tuesday we are not dealing with bidder d i think it is ok legally to go this way although there is potential liability under the warn act the plant closing law we probably can schedule around that exposure though by

and bidder d gets to hire them if they want to in which case the severed employees get no severance payment if they turn dfs down i would like to propose something like the following we provide bidder d with a list of all designated employees their position historical compensation bidder d covenants to make offers to of certain pools of designated employees e g commercial operations engineering trading etc bidder d covenants to make offers that will not allow designated employees to successfully claim constructive dismissal under our severance plan between signing and closing bidder d provide us with a list of offerees designated employees to whom bidder d intends to make offers of employment ena covenants that we will not interfere with bidder d s offers can we bind all of enron if an offeree turns down the offer in writing then ena is free to continue to employee offeree however if we do not continue to employ the offeree no severance is owed the intent of the above is to encourage offerees to take the offers they give up severance rights if they don t but provide us the opportunity to continue to employee anyone who is bold enough to turn it down and that we want to keep also it caps our severance obligation by requiring bidder d to specify how many offers must be made bidder d is certain to want more than this but i am uncomfortable saying we can t continue to employee any of the offerees please advise david i think this point is moot for the time being because as of last tuesday we are not dealing with bidder d i think it is ok legally to go this way although there is potential liability under the warn act the plant closing law we probably can schedule around that exposure though by giving everyone who possibly may be affected days notice

gets to hire them if they want to in which case the severed employees get no severance payment if they turn dfs down i would like to propose something like the following we provide bidder d with a list of all designated employees their position historical compensation bidder d covenants to make offers to of certain pools of designated employees e g commercial operations engineering trading etc bidder d covenants to make offers that will not allow designated employees to successfully claim constructive dismissal under our severance plan between signing and closing bidder d provide us with a list of offerees designated employees to whom bidder d intends to make offers of employment ena covenants that we will not interfere with bidder d s offers can we bind all of enron if an offeree turns down the offer in writing then ena is free to continue to employee offeree however if we do not continue to employ the offeree no severance is owed the intent of the above is to encourage offerees to take the offers they give up severance rights if they don t but provide us the opportunity to continue to employee anyone who is bold enough to turn it down and that we want to keep also it caps our

transaction let me know if you have any questions michelle david oxley pm to michelle cash hou ect ect fran l mayes hou ect ect cc subject triple lutz employee matters what s your view forwarded by david oxley hou ect on pm timothy j detmering pm to david oxley hou ect ect brian redmond hou ect ect patrick wade hou ect ect anne c koehler hou ect ect cc subject triple lutz employee matters with respect to bidder d we are being asked not to compete with them for those employees they would like to hire i e we have to sever them and bidder d gets to hire them if they want to in which case the severed employees get no severance payment if they turn dfs down i would like to propose something like the following we provide bidder d with a list of all designated employees their position historical compensation bidder d covenants to make offers to of certain pools of designated employees e g commercial operations engineering trading etc bidder d covenants to make offers that will not allow designated employees to successfully claim constructive dismissal under our severance plan between signing and closing bidder d provide us with a list of offerees designated employees to whom bidder d intends to make offers of employment ena covenants that we will not interfere with bidder d s offers can we bind all of enron if an offeree turns down the offer in writing then ena is free to continue to employee offeree however if we do not continue to employ the offeree no severance is owed the intent of the above is to encourage offerees to take the offers they give up severance rights if they don t but provide us the opportunity to continue to employee anyone who is bold enough to turn it down and that we want to keep also it caps our severance obligation by requiring bidder d to specify how many offers must be made bidder d is certain to want more than this but i am uncomfortable saying we can t continue to employee any of the offerees please advise david i think this point is moot for the time being because as of last tuesday we are not dealing with bidder d i think it is ok legally to go this way although there is potential liability under the warn act the plant closing law we probably can schedule around that exposure though by giving everyone who possibly may be affected days notice practically however this would not be my favorite approach i d prefer it if we could have the ability to compete for top performers but we should be able to manage that by working through the persons who we identify and present for possible hiring by the buyer i would like

have any questions michelle david oxley pm to michelle cash hou ect ect fran l mayes hou ect ect cc subject triple lutz employee matters what s your view forwarded by david oxley hou ect on pm timothy j detmering pm to david oxley hou ect ect brian redmond hou ect ect patrick wade hou ect ect anne c koehler hou ect ect cc subject triple lutz employee matters with respect to bidder d we are being asked not to compete with them for those employees they would like to hire i e we have to sever them and bidder d gets to hire them if they want to in which case the severed employees get no severance payment if they turn dfs down i would like to propose something like the following we provide bidder d with a list of all designated employees their position historical compensation bidder d covenants to make offers to of certain pools of designated employees e g commercial operations engineering trading etc bidder d covenants to make offers that will not allow designated employees to successfully claim constructive dismissal under our severance plan between signing and closing bidder d provide us with a list of offerees designated employees to whom bidder d intends to make offers of employment ena covenants that we will not interfere with bidder d s offers can we bind all of enron if an offeree turns down the offer in writing then ena is free to continue to employee offeree however if we do not continue to employ the offeree no severance is owed the intent of the above is to encourage offerees to take the offers they give up severance rights if they don t but provide us the opportunity to continue to employee anyone who is bold enough to turn it down and that we want to keep also it caps our severance obligation by requiring bidder d to specify how many offers must be made bidder d is certain to want more than this but i am uncomfortable saying we can t continue to employee any of the offerees please advise david i think this point is moot for the time being because as of last tuesday we are not dealing with bidder d i think it is ok legally to go this way although there is potential liability under the warn act the plant closing law we probably can schedule around that exposure though by giving everyone who possibly may be affected days notice practically however this would not be my favorite approach i d prefer it if we could have the ability to compete for top performers but we should be able to manage that by working through the persons who we identify and present for possible hiring by the buyer i would like more information about what is meant by ena does not interfere with the offers made by the buyer does that mean no counteroffers to answer the question of whether we can bind all of enron i would say that it is unlikely unless we want to ask it

they would like to hire i e we have to sever them and bidder d gets to hire them if they want to in which case the severed employees get no severance payment if they turn dfs down i would like to propose something like the following we provide bidder d with a list of all designated employees their position historical compensation bidder d covenants to make offers to of certain pools of designated employees e g commercial operations engineering trading etc bidder d covenants to make offers that will not allow designated employees to successfully claim constructive dismissal under our severance plan between signing and closing bidder d provide us with a list of offerees designated employees to whom bidder d intends to make offers of employment ena covenants that we will not interfere with bidder d s offers can we bind all of enron if an offeree turns down the offer in writing then ena is free to continue to employee offeree however if we do not continue to employ the offeree no severance is owed the intent of the above is to encourage offerees to take the offers they give up severance rights if they don t but provide us the opportunity to continue to employee anyone who is bold enough to turn it down and that we want to keep also it caps our severance obligation by requiring bidder d to specify how many offers must be made bidder d is certain to want more than this but i am uncomfortable saying we can t continue to employee any of the offerees please advise david i think this point is moot for the time being because as of last tuesday we are not dealing with bidder d i think it is ok legally to go this way although there is potential liability under the warn act the plant closing law we probably can schedule around that exposure though by giving everyone who possibly may be affected days notice practically however this would not be my favorite approach i d prefer it if we could have the ability to compete for top performers but we should be able to manage that by working through the persons who we identify and present for possible hiring by the buyer i would like more information about what is meant by ena does not interfere

and bidder d gets to hire them if they want to in which case the severed employees get no severance payment if they turn dfs down i would like to propose something like the following we provide bidder d with a list of all designated employees their position historical compensation bidder d covenants to make offers to of certain pools of designated employees e g commercial operations engineering trading etc bidder d covenants to make offers that will not allow designated employees to successfully claim constructive dismissal under our severance plan between signing and closing bidder d provide us with a list of offerees designated employees to whom bidder d intends to make offers of employment ena covenants that we will not interfere with bidder d s offers can we bind all of enron if an offeree turns down the offer in writing then ena is free to continue to employee offeree however if we do not continue to employ the offeree no severance is owed the intent of the above is to encourage offerees to take the offers they give up severance rights if they don t but provide us the opportunity to continue to employee anyone who is bold enough to turn it down and that we want to keep also it caps our severance obligation by requiring bidder d to specify how many offers must be made bidder d is certain to want more than this but i am uncomfortable saying we can t continue to employee any of the offerees please advise david i think this point is moot for the time being because as of last tuesday we are not dealing with bidder d i think it is ok legally to go this way although there is potential liability under the warn act the plant closing law we probably can schedule around that exposure though by giving everyone who possibly may be affected days notice practically however this would not be my favorite approach i d prefer it if we could have the ability to compete for top performers but we should be able to manage that by working through the persons who we identify and present for possible hiring by the buyer i would like more information about what is meant by ena does not interfere with the offers made by the buyer does that mean no

gets to hire them if they want to in which case the severed employees get no severance payment if they turn dfs down i would like to propose something like the following we provide bidder d with a list of all designated employees their position historical compensation bidder d covenants to make offers to of certain pools of designated employees e g commercial operations engineering trading etc bidder d covenants to make offers that will not allow designated employees to successfully claim constructive dismissal under our severance plan between signing and closing bidder d provide us with a list of offerees designated employees to whom bidder d intends to make offers of employment ena covenants that we will not interfere with bidder d s offers can we bind all of enron if an offeree turns down the offer in writing then ena is free to continue to employee offeree however if we do not continue to employ the offeree no severance is owed the intent of the above is to encourage offerees to take the offers they give up severance rights if they don t but provide us the opportunity to continue to employee anyone who is bold enough to turn it down and that we want to keep also it caps our severance obligation by requiring bidder d to specify how many offers must be made bidder d is certain to want more than this but i am uncomfortable saying we can t continue to employee any of the offerees please advise david i think this point is moot for the time being because as of last tuesday we are not dealing with bidder d i think it is ok legally to go this way although there is potential liability under the warn act the plant closing law we probably can schedule around that exposure though by giving everyone who possibly may be affected days notice practically however this would not be my favorite approach i d prefer it if we could have the ability to compete for top performers but we should be able to manage that by working through the persons who we identify and present for possible hiring by the buyer i would like more information about what is meant by ena does not interfere with the offers made by the buyer does that mean no counteroffers to answer the

respect to bidder d we are being asked not to compete with them for those employees they would like to hire i e we have to sever them and bidder d gets to hire them if they want to in which case the severed employees get no severance payment if they turn dfs down i would like to propose something like the following we provide bidder d with a list of all designated employees their position historical compensation bidder d covenants to make offers to of certain pools of designated employees e g commercial operations engineering trading etc bidder d covenants to make offers that will not allow designated employees to successfully claim constructive dismissal under our severance plan between signing and closing bidder d provide us with a list of offerees designated employees to whom bidder d intends to make offers of employment ena covenants that we will not interfere with bidder d s offers can we bind all of enron if an offeree turns down the offer in writing then ena is free to continue to employee offeree however if we do not continue to employ the offeree no severance is owed the intent of the above is to encourage offerees to take the offers they give up severance rights if they don t but provide us the opportunity to continue to employee anyone who is bold enough to turn it down and that we want to keep also it caps our severance obligation by requiring bidder d to specify how many offers must be made bidder d is certain to want more than this but i am uncomfortable saying we can t continue to employee any of the offerees please advise david i think this point is moot for the time being because as of last tuesday we are not dealing with bidder d i think it is ok legally to go this way although there is potential liability under the warn act the plant closing law we probably can schedule around that exposure though by giving everyone who possibly may be affected days notice practically however this would not be my favorite approach i d prefer it if we could have the ability to compete for top performers but we should be able to manage that by working through the persons who we identify and present for possible hiring by the buyer i would like more information about what is meant by ena does not interfere with the offers made by the buyer does that mean no counteroffers to answer the question of whether we can bind all of enron i would say that it is unlikely unless we want to ask it is easier to commit only the wholesale group rather than ask corp ees broadband etc whether they will abide by the agreement so i would recommend limiting

asked not to compete with them for those employees they would like to hire i e we have to sever them and bidder d gets to hire them if they want to in which case the severed employees get no severance payment if they turn dfs down i would like to propose something like the following we provide bidder d with a list of all designated employees their position historical compensation bidder d covenants to make offers to of certain pools of designated employees e g commercial operations engineering trading etc bidder d covenants to make offers that will not allow designated employees to successfully claim constructive dismissal under our severance plan between signing and closing bidder d provide us with a list of offerees designated employees to whom bidder d intends to make offers of employment ena covenants that we will not interfere with bidder d s offers can we bind all of enron if an offeree turns down the offer in writing then ena is free to continue to employee offeree however if we do not continue to employ the offeree no severance is owed the intent of the above is to encourage offerees to take the offers they give up severance rights if they don t but provide us the opportunity to continue to employee anyone who is bold enough to turn it down and that we want to keep also it caps our severance obligation by requiring bidder d to specify how many offers must be made bidder d is certain to want more than this but i am uncomfortable saying we can t continue to employee any of the offerees please advise david i think this point is moot for the time being because as of last tuesday we are not dealing with bidder d i think it is ok legally to go this way although there is potential liability under the warn act the plant closing law we probably can schedule around that exposure though by giving everyone who possibly may be affected days notice practically however this would not be my favorite approach i d prefer it if we could have the ability to compete for top performers but we should be able to manage that by working through the persons who we identify and present for possible hiring by the buyer i would like more information about what is meant by ena does not interfere with the offers made by the buyer does that mean no counteroffers to answer the question of whether we can bind all of enron i would say that it is unlikely unless we want to ask it is easier to commit only the wholesale group rather than ask corp ees broadband etc whether they will abide by the agreement so i would recommend limiting it to that group if possible we may be able

redmond hou ect ect patrick wade hou ect ect anne c koehler hou ect ect cc subject triple lutz employee matters with respect to bidder d we are being asked not to compete with them for those employees they would like to hire i e we have to sever them and bidder d gets to hire them if they want to in which case the severed employees get no severance payment if they turn dfs down i would like to propose something like the following we provide bidder d with a list of all designated employees their position historical compensation bidder d covenants to make offers to of certain pools of designated employees e g commercial operations engineering trading etc bidder d covenants to make offers that will not allow designated employees to successfully claim constructive dismissal under our severance plan between signing and closing bidder d provide us with a list of offerees designated employees to whom bidder d intends to make offers of employment ena covenants that we will not interfere with bidder d s offers can we bind all of enron if an offeree turns down the offer in writing then ena is free to continue to employee offeree however if we do not continue to employ the offeree no severance is owed the intent of the above is to encourage offerees to take the offers they give up severance rights if they don t but provide us the opportunity to continue to employee anyone who is bold enough to turn it down and that we want to keep also it caps our severance obligation by requiring bidder d to specify how many offers must be made bidder d is certain to want more than this but i am uncomfortable saying we can t continue to employee any of the offerees please advise david i think this point is moot for the time being because as of last tuesday we are not dealing with bidder d i think it is ok legally to go this way although there is potential liability under the warn act the plant closing law we probably can schedule around that exposure though by giving everyone who possibly may be affected days notice practically however this would not be my favorite approach i d prefer it if we could have the ability to compete for top performers but we should be able to manage that by working through the persons who we identify and present for possible hiring by the buyer i would like more information about what is meant by ena does not interfere with the offers made by the buyer does that mean no counteroffers to answer the question of whether we can bind all of enron i would say that it is unlikely unless we want to ask it is easier to commit only the wholesale group rather than ask corp ees broadband etc whether they will abide by the agreement so i would recommend limiting it to that group if possible we may be able to include the

and bidder d gets to hire them if they want to in which case the severed employees get no severance payment if they turn dfs down i would like to propose something like the following we provide bidder d with a list of all designated employees their position historical compensation bidder d covenants to make offers to of certain pools of designated employees e g commercial operations engineering trading etc bidder d covenants to make offers that will not allow designated employees to successfully claim constructive dismissal under our severance plan between signing and closing bidder d provide us with a list of offerees designated employees to whom bidder d intends to make offers of employment ena covenants that we will not interfere with bidder d s offers can we bind all of enron if an offeree turns down the offer in writing then ena is free to continue to employee offeree however if we do not continue to employ the offeree no severance is owed the intent of the above is to encourage offerees to take the offers they give up severance rights if they don t but provide us the opportunity to continue to employee anyone who is bold enough to turn it down and that we want to keep also it caps our severance obligation by requiring bidder d to specify how many offers must be made bidder d is certain to want more than this but i am uncomfortable saying we can t continue to employee any of the offerees please advise david i think this point is moot for the time being because as of last tuesday we are not dealing with bidder d i think it is ok legally to go this way although there is potential liability under the warn act the plant closing law we probably can schedule around that exposure though by giving everyone who possibly may be affected days notice practically however this would not be my favorite approach i d prefer it if we could have the ability to compete for top performers but we should be able to manage that by working through the persons who we identify and present for possible hiring by the buyer i would like more information about what is meant by ena does not interfere with the offers made by the buyer does that mean no counteroffers to answer the question of whether we can bind all of enron i would say that it is unlikely unless we want to ask it is easier to commit only the wholesale group rather than ask corp ees broadband etc whether they will abide by the agreement so i would recommend limiting it to that group if possible we may be able to include the pipelines given that they have been involved in this

ect ect cc subject triple lutz employee matters with respect to bidder d we are being asked not to compete with them for those employees they would like to hire i e we have to sever them and bidder d gets to hire them if they want to in which case the severed employees get no severance payment if they turn dfs down i would like to propose something like the following we provide bidder d with a list of all designated employees their position historical compensation bidder d covenants to make offers to of certain pools of designated employees e g commercial operations engineering trading etc bidder d covenants to make offers that will not allow designated employees to successfully claim constructive dismissal under our severance plan between signing and closing bidder d provide us with a list of offerees designated employees to whom bidder d intends to make offers of employment ena covenants that we will not interfere with bidder d s offers can we bind all of enron if an offeree turns down the offer in writing then ena is free to continue to employee offeree however if we do not continue to employ the offeree no severance is owed the intent of the above is to encourage offerees to take the offers they give up severance rights if they don t but provide us the opportunity to continue to employee anyone who is bold enough to turn it down and that we want to keep also it caps our severance obligation by requiring bidder d to specify how many offers must be made bidder d is certain to want more than this but i am uncomfortable saying we can t continue to employee any of the offerees please advise david i think this point is moot for the time being because as of last tuesday we are not dealing with bidder d i think it is ok legally to go this way although there is potential liability under the warn act the plant closing law we probably can schedule around that exposure though by giving everyone who possibly may be affected days notice practically however this would not be my favorite approach i d prefer it if we could have the ability to compete for top performers but we should be able to manage that by working through the persons who we identify and present for possible hiring by the buyer i would like more information about what is meant by ena does not interfere with the offers made by the buyer does that mean no counteroffers to answer the question of whether we can bind all of enron i would say that it is unlikely unless we want to ask it is easier to commit only the wholesale group rather than ask corp ees broadband etc whether they will abide by the agreement so i would recommend limiting it to that group if possible we may be able to include the pipelines given that they have been involved in this transaction let me know if you

respect to bidder d we are being asked not to compete with them for those employees they would like to hire i e we have to sever them and bidder d gets to hire them if they want to in which case the severed employees get no severance payment if they turn dfs down i would like to propose something like the following we provide bidder d with a list of all designated employees their position historical compensation bidder d covenants to make offers to of certain pools of designated employees e g commercial operations engineering trading etc bidder d covenants to make offers that will not allow designated employees to successfully claim constructive dismissal under our severance plan between signing and closing bidder d provide us with a list of offerees designated employees to whom bidder d intends to make offers of employment ena covenants that we will not interfere with bidder d s offers can we bind all of enron if an offeree turns down the offer in writing then ena is free to continue to employee offeree however if we do not continue to employ the offeree no severance is owed the intent of the above is to encourage offerees to take the offers they give up severance rights if they don t but provide us the opportunity to continue to employee anyone who is bold enough to turn it down and that we want to keep also it caps our severance obligation by requiring bidder d to specify how many offers must be made bidder d is certain to want more than this but i am uncomfortable saying we can t continue to employee any of the offerees please advise david i think this point is moot for the time being because as of last tuesday we are not dealing with bidder d i think it is ok legally to go this way although there is potential liability under the warn act the plant closing law we probably can schedule around that exposure though by giving everyone who possibly may be affected days notice practically however this would not be my favorite approach i d prefer it if we could have the ability to compete for top performers but we should be able to manage that by working through the persons who we identify and present for possible hiring by the buyer i would like more information about what is meant by ena does not interfere with the offers made by the buyer does that mean no counteroffers to answer the question of whether we can bind all of enron i would say that it is unlikely unless we want to ask it is easier to commit only the wholesale group rather than ask corp ees broadband etc whether they will abide by the agreement so i would recommend limiting it to that group if possible we may be able to include the pipelines given that they have been involved in this transaction let me know if you have any questions michelle david oxley pm to michelle

asked not to compete with them for those employees they would like to hire i e we have to sever them and bidder d gets to hire them if they want to in which case the severed employees get no severance payment if they turn dfs down i would like to propose something like the following we provide bidder d with a list of all designated employees their position historical compensation bidder d covenants to make offers to of certain pools of designated employees e g commercial operations engineering trading etc bidder d covenants to make offers that will not allow designated employees to successfully claim constructive dismissal under our severance plan between signing and closing bidder d provide us with a list of offerees designated employees to whom bidder d intends to make offers of employment ena covenants that we will not interfere with bidder d s offers can we bind all of enron if an offeree turns down the offer in writing then ena is free to continue to employee offeree however if we do not continue to employ the offeree no severance is owed the intent of the above is to encourage offerees to take the offers they give up severance rights if they don t but provide us the opportunity to continue to employee anyone who is bold enough to turn it down and that we want to keep also it caps our severance obligation by requiring bidder d to specify how many offers must be made bidder d is certain to want more than this but i am uncomfortable saying we can t continue to employee any of the offerees please advise david i think this point is moot for the time being because as of last tuesday we are not dealing with bidder d i think it is ok legally to go this way although there is potential liability under the warn act the plant closing law we probably can schedule around that exposure though by giving everyone who possibly may be affected days notice practically however this would not be my favorite approach i d prefer it if we could have the ability to compete for top performers but we should be able to manage that by working through the persons who we identify and present for possible hiring by the buyer i would like more information about what is meant by ena does not interfere with the offers made by the buyer does that mean no counteroffers to answer the question of whether we can bind all of enron i would say that it is unlikely unless we want to ask it is easier to commit only the wholesale group rather than ask corp ees broadband etc whether they will abide by the agreement so i would recommend limiting it to that group if possible we may be able to include the pipelines given that they have been involved in this transaction let me know if you have any questions michelle david oxley pm to michelle cash hou ect ect fran l mayes hou ect ect cc
