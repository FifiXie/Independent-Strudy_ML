## Independent-Strudy_ML

### An indenpendent Study at the Parsons School of Design with Aaron Hill

#### The course started with trying to develop a better understanding on natural language processing. I started with looking at different types of datat set.
#### I became particularly interested in the Enron Email datda set, and see potential building an interesting model out of it.
#### I also attempted to work with Recurrent Neural Networks, however, I wasn't able to fully understand the model and didn't reach a workable state with that.
#### Afterwards I started playing with the Markov model, it was great because many people has done loads of work with it. I was able to find enough  resources to work with that. However, at the end, it didn't feel like I really achived what I wanted to do : given every two words, predict the third based on the datatet.
#### My final attempted was to create a simple algorithm where it counts every three word combo, and for each combo assign a value to 1, adds all the values together. Counts every ouccurance of the combo and then devided by the total value to find the most high probable word following two words.

#### You can find most of my test in Itr 1, the final model is in the final folder/itr 2
